## SAT Math Toolbar (extension)

when I was practicing for the SAT, I always found it annoying to switch tabs - one for desmps, another for the formula sheet - while trying to stay focused on the problem. now, as an online tutor, i see my students running into the exact same issue. it feels weird telling them to hop between windows when the real test keeps everything in one place.

so i made this extension - it puts the tools (desmos graphing calculator and ref sheet) right there ton top of the screen on the same page - no more switching tabs and you can practice in the same flow and format as you'll see on the test day.

<img src="assets/ref_sheet.png" alt="draggable ref sheet" width="550px"/>
